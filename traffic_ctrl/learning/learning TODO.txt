MULTI START
	1. How much noise to apply? 10% zero-mean Gaussian noise.
	2. Can noise starting points be infeasible or do we need to clip the noise back into feasibility (this might be difficult in some cases)
	3. Parallel for loop - Can ipopt be run in parallel? Yes


LOGGING
	1. use python logging mechanism to log data during learning.
	2. Structure of the log: something like a csv, i.e., first row is the header, and then each row contains N numbers.
	3. In binary or human-readable?
	4. Create util to quickly read and plot the logging.
	
	
LEARNING
	1. create scenario where there's an evident discrepancy in performance between MPC with perfect knowledge and MPC with modified parameters 
		- modified a 
		- modified learnable rho crit
		- modified learnable v_free

	2. create a learning algorithm 
		- it learns
			- parameters rho_crit and v_free
			- cost function: quadratic in state and control (with rho_crit tracking) 
				-> look at S. Gros' students' papers
		- RL
			- Q learning with experience replay
			- learning rate
			- discount
			- introduce random disturbance in cost to induce exploration?
			- introduce cost for constraint violation, i.e., w^T * max(0, g(x))

	(might need to log intermediate results since simulations will be long)
