This folder contains the work related to MPC-based Q-learning for traffic control applications.
The subfolders are

	- comparison: contains Python and Matlab scripts to run a comparison between a full-knowledge MPC controller versus an MPC with wrong model parameters. The aim is to create a scenario where learning can be beneficial
	
	- learning: contains Python and Matlab scripts to run an MPC-based LSTDQ algorithm to learn to control the same traffic control scenario
